class Note:
    """
    Represents a musical note from the twelve-tone chromatic scale.

    Attributes:
        position (int): The position on the chromatic scale (0 for A, 1 for A#/Bb, ..., 11 for G#/Ab).
        perspective (str or None): The accidental perspective of the note; possible values:
            "#"  - represents a sharp view.
            "b"  - represents a flat view.
            None - no specific perspective (used for naturals or displaying both names for accidentals).
    
    Initialization:
        The first parameter may be either:
          - A note name (string) e.g., "C", "C#", "Gb". The position is determined using the POSITIONS dict.
          - An integer (0-11) indicating the note's position directly.
          
        The second, optional parameter is the perspective ("#" or "b"). If it is provided and not None, 
        it overrides any accidental indication in the note name. If not provided or is None:
            - and if the note name includes an accidental, the perspective is taken from that name.
            - otherwise, perspective is set to None.
